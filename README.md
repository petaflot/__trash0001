This is a library for the Arduino to drive and LTC6803-based circuit.

The circuit consists of three HF-isolated 12-cell monitors originially
designed for solar applications. A friend got a number of these second-hand
parts so I gave him a hand to communicate witht the chips on board.

Since the circuit was covered in protective resin, it took us some time to
figure out what the onboard CPU was ; so in the mean time I removed one and
made a connector for an Arduino or similar micro-controller.

The file 36-cell_battery_monitor.pdf is a cut-down (or rather built-up)
version of the board schematic. Much is missing and some things have been
simplified for the sake of time and usability.
